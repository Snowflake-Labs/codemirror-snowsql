# codemirror-snowsql
This project is to use the lezer-snowsql grammar to add parsing and linting capabilities to codemirror for editing SnowSQL
This branch has an editor built using codemirror 6 and lezer parser. It is able to provide linting and autocomplete for the select query of SQL. This was built taking inpiration from CodeMirror-PromQL. There are still a few promql constructs in the code. This is currently a work in progress.
