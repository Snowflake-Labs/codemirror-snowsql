## Overview

This project provides a mode for [CodeMirror Next](https://codemirror.net/6) that handles syntax highlighting, linting
and autocompletion for PromQL ([Prometheus Query Language](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)).

### Installation

This mode is available as a npm package:

```bash
npm install --save codemirror-promql
```

**Note:** You will have to manually install different packages that are part of [CodeMirror Next](https://codemirror.net/6), as
they are a peer dependency to this package. Here are the different packages you need to install:

* **@codemirror/autocomplete**
* **@codemirror/highlight**
* **@codemirror/language**
* **@codemirror/lint**
* **@codemirror/state**
* **@codemirror/view**

```bash
npm install --save @codemirror/autocomplete @codemirror/highlight @codemirror/language @codemirror/lint @codemirror/state @codemirror/view
```

**Note 2**: that's the minimum required to install the lib. You would probably need to install as well the dependency
**@codemirror/basic-setup** to ease the setup of codeMirror itself:

```bash
npm install --save @codemirror/basic-setup
```

### Playground

[Here](https://codemirror-promql.netlify.app/) you have a playground available that is deployed from the latest commit available on the `master` branch.

Here is a short preview of it looks like currently:

## Usage

As the setup of the PromQL language can a bit tricky in CMN, this lib provides a class `snowsqlExtension`
which is here to help you to configure the different extensions we aim to provide.

### Default setup

If you want to enjoy about the different features provided without taking too much time to understand how to configure
them, then the easiest way is this one:

```typescript
import { snowsqlExtension } from 'codemirror-promql';
import { basicSetup } from '@codemirror/basic-setup';
import { EditorState } from '@codemirror/state';
import { EditorView } from '@codemirror/view';

const promQL = new snowsqlExtension()
new EditorView({
  state: EditorState.create({
    extensions: [basicSetup, promQL.asExtension()],
  }),
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion
  // tslint:disable-next-line:no-non-null-assertion
  parent: document.getElementById('editor')!,
});
```

Using the default setup will activate:

* syntax highlighting
* an offline autocompletion that will suggest PromQL keywords such as functions / aggregations, depending on the
  context.
* an offline linter that will display PromQL syntax errors (which is closer to what Prometheus returns)

### Deactivate autocompletion - linter

In case you would like to deactivate the linter and/or the autocompletion it's simple as that:

```typescript
const promQL = new snowsqlExtension().activateLinter(false).activateCompletion(false) // here the linter and the autocomplete are deactivated
```

### maxMetricsMetadata

`maxMetricsMetadata` is the maximum number of metrics in Prometheus for which metadata is fetched. If the number of
metrics exceeds this limit, no metric metadata is fetched at all.

By default, the limit is 10 000 metrics.

Use it cautiously. A high value of this limit can cause a crash of your browser due to too many data fetched.

```typescript
const promQL = new snowsqlExtension().setComplete({ maxMetricsMetadata: 10000 })
```

### Connect the autocompletion extension to a remote Prometheus server

Connecting the autocompletion extension to a remote Prometheus server will provide autocompletion of metric names, label
names, and label values.

#### Use the default Prometheus client

##### Prometheus URL

If you want to use the default Prometheus client provided by this lib, you have to provide the url used to contact the
Prometheus server.

```typescript
const promQL = new snowsqlExtension().setComplete({ remote: { url: 'https://prometheus.land' } })
```

##### Override FetchFn

In case your Prometheus server is protected and requires a special HTTP client, you can override the function `fetchFn`
that is used to perform any required HTTP request.

```typescript
const promQL = new snowsqlExtension().setComplete({ remote: { fetchFn: myHTTPClient } })
```

##### Error Handling

You can set up your own error handler to catch any HTTP error that can occur when the PrometheusClient is contacting
Prometheus.

```typescript
const promQL = new snowsqlExtension().setComplete({ remote: { httpErrorHandler: (error: any) => console.error(error) } })
```

#### Override the default Prometheus client

In case you are not satisfied by our default Prometheus client, you can still provide your own. It has to implement the
interface [PrometheusClient](https://github.com/prometheus-community/codemirror-promql/blob/master/src/lang-promql/client/prometheus.ts#L111-L117)
.

```typescript
const promQL = new snowsqlExtension().setComplete({ remote: { prometheusClient: MyPrometheusClient } })
```

### Example

* The development [app](./src/app) can give you an example of how to use it with no TS Framework.
* [ReactJS example](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/431ea75a11ca165dad9dd5d629b3cf975f4c186b/web/ui/react-app/src/pages/graph/CMExpressionInput.tsx)
* [Angular example](https://github.com/perses/perses/blob/28b3bdac88b0ed7a4602f9c91106442eafcb6c34/internal/api/front/perses/src/app/project/prometheusrule/promql-editor/promql-editor.component.ts)

## Contributions

Any contribution or suggestion would be really appreciated. Feel free
to [file an issue](https://github.com/prometheus-community/codemirror-promql/issues)
or [send a pull request](https://github.com/prometheus-community/codemirror-promql/pulls).

## Development

In case you want to contribute and change the code by yourself, run the following commands:

To install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start the web server:

```
npm start
```

This should create a tab in your browser with the development app that contains CodeMirror Next with the PromQL plugin.
