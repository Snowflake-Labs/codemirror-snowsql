# codemirror-snowsql
This project is to use the lezer-snowsql grammar to add parsing and linting capabilities to codemirror for editing SnowSQL
This branch has an editor built using codemirror 6 and lezer parser. It is able to provide linting and autocomplete for the select query of SQL. This was built taking inpiration from CodeMirror-PromQL. There are still a few promql constructs in the code. This is currently a work in progress. 
=======

## Development

In case you want to contribute and change the code by yourself, run the following commands:

To install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start the web server:

```
npm start
```

This should create a tab in your browser with the development app that contains CodeMirror Next with the PromQL plugin.
